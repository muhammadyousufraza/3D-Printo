WPC Product Options brings about the power of adjusting prices with highly customizable additional fields for products.

== Description ==

**WPC Product Options for WooCommerce** will become another essential plugin for any kind of online stores, which brings about the power of adjusting prices with highly customizable additional fields for simple products.

Users can insert up to 18+ different types of custom add-ons to simple products so that customers can easily configure their preferences. Online stores that emphasize personalization & customized designs, take in on-demands orders, and have sophisticated products with complex configurations will benefit from this plugin the most.

Three modes available: Global, Override, and Disable. Users can configure as many premade fields as they want and use them as global add-ons to insert to multiple products at a time using product types, categories, tags, brands, attributes, etc. In Override, custom add-ons for individual products can be specified easily in the same way as Global add-ons.

Especially, usres can use the Shortcode field to insert anything they want using short-code, for example, a Countdown Timer for flash sale counting or size chart. Another special thing about WPC Product Options for WooCommerce is that users can define a new custom price formula that suits their products well. There are some special goods and services requiring special pricing for add-ons and this is available right in our plugin.

- **Quantity synced**: When customers increase or decrease the quantity of the main product, the Quantity synced price means the unit price, so it will be multiplied by the chosen value of the main quantity.
